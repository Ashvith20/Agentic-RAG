Modernization vs. Modularization: Understanding the Difference | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Modernization vs. Modularization: Understanding the Difference March 11, 2024Healthcare is changing rapidly, and technology is both propelling this transformation and struggling to keep up with it.Medicaid, and the healthcare safety net it provides to millions of Americans, sits at the same nexus of opportunity and challenge as the rest of the healthcare industry. Meeting the needs of members today and in the future — and in fact securing the sustainability of state Medicaid programs — will require the evolution of current technology systems. All stakeholders agree on this. However, there is no clear consensus on the best way to achieve modernization.Following the First MoversIn recent years, modularity has been a common thread across the modernization efforts of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The thought behind this is that dividing complex Medicaid management systems into separate, scalable components that address specific business functions will afford states greater cost savings, flexibility, vendor diversity and efficiency within their programs. However, experience has shown that modernizing through modular replacement is not the sole answer for states pursuing modernized Medicaid systems.Evolving the Medicaid EnterpriseTo support the dynamic nature of public health in the digital age, it’s necessary to embrace new ways of thinking and adapting technology. States are taking increasingly diverse approaches to evolving their systems for the outcomes they aim to achieve today and in the future. Some states are incorporating modularity into their existing systems. Others are making incremental, in-place enhancements to improve current care quality and access while maximizing resources for other initiatives that will benefit citizens in the long term.Modernization efforts can be as extensive as a replacement of an MMIS business area with a fully modular solution or as small-scale as a new data interface, rules engine or user experience enhancement.As states journey to a more modern enterprise, here are two prevalent paths that have emerged.Modernization Through Modular ReplacementModular replacement is a strategy that seeks to break up an MMIS system into individual, business-specific components to align with CMS’ original modernization vision: for states to move away from a single, monolithic system. Instead, a modular ecosystem could allow for greater innovation and flexibility in serving Medicaid members.The intention of this approach is to enable states to implement a modular claims and encounter processing system and then incrementally replace other adjacent Medicaid business functions. Discrete modules are loosely coupled together, working seamlessly to support the timely delivery of services and a more streamlined flow of information across programs.Modernization in PlaceModernization in place is an alternate strategy that includes direct system enhancements to the current core system and involves the implementation of modular solutions around core MMIS functions. Incremental updates to an in-place system could include the adoption of completely new cloud-based technologies, an investment in advanced analytics and AI capabilities, or any number of performance and efficiency-enhancing measures that will drive states toward their desired business outcomes.Modernization in place may be an appealing option for states looking to achieve near-term business value while sustaining their core claims and encounter processing operations as they build out their long-term technology roadmaps.The Most Successful Modernization ApproachHow states choose to modernize their systems is a decision that must be based on state-specific priorities, risk tolerance, desired outcomes, budgetary considerations, and the current and desired technical capabilities of their Medicaid systems. It is critical that these factors are evaluated carefully before a modernization approach is determined.A complete overhaul of core MMIS functionality may indeed be required to deliver the benefits of the latest technologies. However, making strategic enhancements to current systems might be a perfectly acceptable solution to accelerate enhanced functionality.Clearly, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. And while modularization can be a powerful solution, it isn’t the only solution. The most successful modernization approach for a state to take is one that is driven by its specific objectives for the programs it administers and the populations it serves.For a more in-depth look at Medicaid modernization, read our white paper, Modernizing Medicaid: An Outcomes-Based Roadmap.

Blog: Applying Programmatic Analytics to Improve Outcomes, Reduce Costs for Complex Populations & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Can Data Help Solve Longstanding Challenges in Medicaid? December 6, 2023Gary Call, M.D. and Carl Frankel, Ph.D.Which approaches are most effective at improving individual wellbeing and population health? What financial investments yield the greatest results in enabling greater longevity and quality of life for Medicaid members? Which interventions and investments fall short in achieving intended goals?As state Medicaid agencies face growing pressure to demonstrate and improve the effectiveness of their programs and initiatives, the ability to answer questions like these is becoming essential. That’s especially true when it comes to understanding the value of large, highly visible programs where expenses can really stack up.Significant work is already being done to measure aspects of care quality and outcomes among beneficiaries of Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). For instance, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requires states to report, on an annual basis, a set of core quality measures to strengthen health outcomes among children and adults.When dealing with complex and fragile populations, however, it becomes more challenging to weave data into a fuller picture of what’s working, what’s not working and how adjustments could contribute to better results.More challenging — but not impossible. Tackling an ‘Unsolvable’ ChallengeFor every state, caring for those with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI) has long been a significant challenge. These individuals represent at least 20% of Medicaid members, with the unstable 60+% of this population costing more than four times as much as their counterparts without severe mental illness.Despite higher spending, many physical disorders are three to four times more prevalent in this population. What’s more, among those with SPMI, the severity of those disorders is worse — and life expectancy is, on average, 10 to 15 years shorter.These statistics aren’t new. In fact, for many years, the SPMI population has been regarded as an unsolvable challenge. That view is not only inaccurate, but also increasingly untenable as CMS asks states to deliver more equitable outcomes for these members by moving toward integrative care across the bio-psycho-social continuum.Through our collaboration with one particular state Medicaid program, ’ analytics have demonstrated that there are ways to improve outcomes and reduce costs for the SPMI population. Using Programmatic Analytics to Evaluate and Improve OutcomesBefore engaging Gainwell, the state had established an innovative intervention — a behavioral health (BH) health home to provide integrative care coordination for those with SPMI. The goal: to start moving the needle for these Medicaid members.With the BH health home up and running, the state wanted to know: Are this program’s care coordination services really making an important difference for those who use them?To answer this question, the state asked Gainwell to make a quantum leap in program evaluation analytics, beyond the standard metrics they were already collecting. Specifically, the state wanted a longitudinal assessment of overall program effectiveness. Moreover, the state’s team wanted a degree of robustness and replicability we’d not much seen in the reports that other states have published about their programs’ performance. As part of the required robustness, the state’s team asked explicitly for “error bars” — that is, estimates of the confidence the state could place in the findings. That way, the state could move forward with the solid results, not the shaky ones.We rose to this challenge by creating an analytics solution that surfaces the impact of multiple drivers on four-year risk of all-causes mortality and on total cost of care, for those with SPMI who were referred to the health home. We also reused the same set of drivers in evaluating both outcomes — so that the state could see how the same drivers are in play in both longevity and cost. The result was a first: an overarching programmatic view of the state’s innovation program, which Medicaid agencies can’t achieve with industry-standard analytics.The good news? Gainwell’s programmatic analytics clearly characterized how the state’s innovative BH health home is, in fact, starting to move a historically entrenched needle for the SPMI population. Beyond that, the solution surfaced additional insights about the interdependence of physical and psychological wellbeing for those with SPMI. And it pointed to opportunities for this program to provide more comprehensive care for the SPMI population, and the financial case for doing so. Using our solution — which runs in the cloud — we delivered a comprehensive understanding of the various drivers that impact health outcomes and TCOC among the SPMI population. Findings of the Health Outcome EstimatorFour years is an unusually short time to evaluate mortality risk (consider, for example, that 10 years is the period commonly used with heart disease). However, in a population with life expectancy shortened by 10 to 15 years, four years is a long time. As a result, the Health Outcome Estimator yielded several findings in which the state can have solid confidence.First, the Health Outcome Estimator showed that participation in the BH health home reduced four-year mortality for those with SPMI who received care coordination at least one time (about half of those referred). Using this estimator, we also found that, just like increased complexity of physical disorders, increased psychiatric complexity is associated with increased four-year mortality risk for those with SPMI. What’s more, this estimator showed that being seen and treated for non-lethal disorders is associated with reduced four-year mortality risk for those with SPMI.Beyond the value of staying the course with its current BH health home intervention, from this single estimator, the state gained actionable insights about how to shape interventions for the SPMI population. For example, the findings suggest that simple complaints — like headache or digestive upset — can be gateways to other needed, sometimes life-saving diagnoses and treatments.The findings also indicate benefit to increasing the focus on earlier, decisive intervention into those life-threatening physical disorders that are more prevalent among the SPMI population (like diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, among others). Because these individuals often have long neglected their own healthcare, their disorders may have advanced to more severe stages. Findings of the Cost Outcome EstimatorThrough the Cost Outcome Estimator, we learned that for those with SPMI, psychiatric complexity alone exerts significant upward pressure on TCOC, in addition to the pressure exerted by complexity of physical disorders.Because members with SPMI often neglect their own health for years or even decades, care costs increase when they start receiving care coordination and begin catching up with their medical needs. However, once these members engage with the BH health home, their health status stabilizes and improves — and TCOC, no longer in runaway, drops by more than 5% per year.Again, from a single estimator, the state gained actionable insights about how the BH health home was working to transform runaway cost growth into steady cost reduction. Further, the estimator supports better financial planning by illuminating an expectable burst of members’ “catch-up” cost on program entry. Programmatic Analytics: A New ‘Power Tool’ for Medicaid AgenciesThese two estimators provide a strong first demonstration for a program’s robust, longitudinal equity improvement and total cost reduction. Such a foundation is key to justifying large, expensive programs for the SPMI population.Yet these two estimators are just part of Gainwell’s programmatic analytics capability. Serving the SPMI population is just one example where programmatic analytics can produce fresh insights into the drivers of multifaceted challenges, the potential solutions to those challenges, and the tangible mechanisms for measuring and continually improving outcomes.Indeed, the approach we took with this state generalizes to other interventions for complex, fragile populations. In addition to evaluating programs, the same estimators can help in assessing the performance of MCOs, hospitals, practices, providers and other intermediaries in the delivery of care. They can even be applied to individual members for triage, stratification and care personalization. Gainwell’s programmatic analytics offer a new, qualitatively more comprehensive power-tool.This post’s title asks, Can Data Help Solve Longstanding Challenges in Medicaid? We believe the answer is a resounding “yes,” not only for the challenges presented by those with SPMI but also for many of the challenges Medicaid agencies face.

Bringing Technology to Life: Elevating Customer Experience in Medicaid & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Transforming Medicaid: The Unsung Heroes Behind a Better Tomorrow November 15, 2023Colleen RitchieWhen we dive into the world of massive, intricate systems like Medicaid, the conversation often revolves around the complex web of data, technology and regulations surrounding this vital healthcare program. Undoubtedly, these components are essential, but there’s an unsung hero that deserves the spotlight: the people.As we continue to build smarter, more interactive technology platforms, it’s crucial to remember the heartbeat of it all: dedicated individuals committed to the mission. They are the driving force, ensuring that states can provide essential support to their most vulnerable communities. Handling countless phone calls, managing complex transactions, authorizing life-saving treatments and tackling a myriad of challenges with unwavering skill — that’s just another day in the life of these remarkable team members.But their role isn’t confined to these tasks alone. They are also the architects of innovation as they push the boundaries of technology and processes, delivering an unparalleled customer experience to both members and providers.Turning Real-World Challenges into Innovative SolutionsThrough Gainwell’s Customer Experience services, we handle millions of transactions and calls annually for states across the nation. It’s our goal to provide a seamless, frictionless experience for every customer we serve. To meet that goal, we must continually examine every business process and tool, uncover any gaps in service and then work hard to fill those gaps.Customer Experience team members are on the front lines, experiencing firsthand the concerns of members and providers. We witness the friction points, giving us a unique perspective on where improvements can be made.Many software companies simply develop technology tools and outsource everything else. However, with that structure in place, the organization has no direct link to people who can tell them what’s broken or how they can innovate next.By operating both a technology platform and a customer experience department, we’re able to create a cycle of continuous improvement. Our team is the ultimate communications center, offering feedback and bringing concerns both big and small to the attention of our leadership team. Resolved problems can potentially become innovative new features benefitting states, boosting service levels and improving lives.While our team members work for Gainwell, we never lose sight of our deep connection to the states we support. We are an integral part of the state’s mission to deliver high-quality, compassionate care as efficiently as possible. We often find ourselves navigating uncharted territory in the Medicaid space, helping people in crisis. This sense of ownership, combined with open channels for feedback, forms the bedrock of a customer experience that’s continually evolving and improving.From Valued Vendor to Trusted AdvisorAs we move forward and adopt new methods to automate processes and complete tasks, Gainwell aims to be an even more useful resource for states. We anticipate and solve for problems before they arise. We bring new ideas to the table and demonstrate more efficient ways to serve members and providers. With this approach, we’re a cohesive team that’s actively shaping solutions.As a trusted advisor and a genuine partner to state agencies, we are developing new processes for innovating, leading and sharing solutions with multiple state Medicaid systems. But, it all starts with people — individuals who listen, are empowered to voice their concerns and have an unshakable passion for delivering an extraordinary customer experience to some of society’s most vulnerable. By bringing technology to life, we can truly impact people’s lives.

In the event we implement automated decision-making technology, you may obtain information regarding this process by contacting us in writing as set forth in “Contact Information,” below.How to Submit a Request. California residents can exercise their privacy rights by submitting a request to us at compliance@gainwelltechnologies.com or calling us toll free at 1-877-586-1700. The verifiable request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. The verifiable request must also describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.Verifying Requests. To help protect the privacy of California residents requesting to exercise their privacy rights (“Requestors”) and maintain security, we will take steps to verify the Requestors’ identity before granting access to their personal information or complying with their request. If a Requestor asks us to provide them with specific pieces of personal information, we may require they sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that they are the individual whose personal information is the subject of the request and provide appropriate proof of identity.For requests to know or delete information about a child under the age of 13, we accept requests for information regarding minors under the age of 13 if we can determine that such requests were submitted by a parent or guardian.Authorized agents may initiate a request on behalf of an individual using the same methods described above. Authorized agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization, and we may also require that the individual directly verify their identity and the authority of the authorized agent. Individuals may also provide us with a signed and dated power of attorney naming the authorized agent as their representative.Responding to Requests. Within 10 days of receiving a request to delete, to correct, or to know, we will confirm receipt of the request and provide information about how we will process the request. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform the Requestor of the reason and extension period in writing. We may deny the request if we cannot verify the individual’s identity or are legally permitted to deny the request, such as if doing so proves impossible or would involve disproportionate effort.If we deny the request, we will explain the basis for the denial, provide or delete any personal information that is not subject to the denial, and refrain from using the personal information retained for any purpose other than permitted by the denial. We will maintain a record of the request and our response for 24 months. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to verifiable requests unless they are excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell the Requestor why we made that decision and provide them with a cost estimate before completing the request.Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information. To the extent we “sell” or “share” your personal information (as those terms are defined under CCPA), California residents have the right to opt out of that “sale” or “sharing” on a going-forward basis at any time. . To exercise this right, contact us at compliance@gainwelltechnologies.com.You may also be able to restrict the collection of personal information through your device’s operating system or by disabling cookies, but doing so may prevent you from using the functionality of the websites. If your browser supports it, you can turn on the Global Privacy Control (GPC) to opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal data. We honor the GPC and other universal opt out signals where we are required to do so by applicable law.

Community Engagement Verification Made Simple | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Community Engagement Verification Made Simple August 25, 2025H.R. 1 is bringing sweeping change to Medicaid across eligibility, financing, and service delivery. Medicaid agencies across the country are acting now to begin implementing the new program integrity measures. One provision in H.R. 1 is particularly concerning for states: community engagement verification.This is the requirement to verify that certain adult beneficiaries meet work and community-engagement standards to maintain enrollment in Medicaid. In theory, compliance sounds straightforward. Yet in practice, the risk of unnecessary member churn, staff overload, and damaging headlines is very real. Fortunately, states that excel in executing community engagement verification can unlock benefits that go far beyond compliance.A Perfect Storm of ChallengesState Medicaid agencies are no strangers to change. They know that it is inevitable, and they have a long track record of successfully adapting to new mandates.But community engagement verification is different.Multiple issues are coming together for a perfect storm of challenges. The timeline for establishing a fair and flexible verification process is tight. States may have to act before all federal guidance is finalized. CMS has indicated that there will be very limited (if any) waivers for extension. There are also resource constraints. Eligibility teams already stretched by redeterminations now face yet another compliance sprint. The stakes are high, too. Inaccurate disenrollments can trigger audit findings and push eligible members off coverage.The Fundamentals of an Effective ApproachThe good news is that there is a way through these challenges that does not require states to modify their already complex eligibility systems. States can execute community engagement verification and do much more than satisfy H.R. 1 auditors. They can extract the process out of the eligibility system, handling it with a flexible, cost-effective, modular, portable, self-contained platform that can seamlessly connect in and out of the eligibility system with APIs. An approach like this that is independent of the eligibility system but integrated with it gives states the agility they need to flex fast with change. It is also fully auditable and reportable.Think of this mandate not as just a compliance obligation, but as a value creation opportunity. With cleaner eligibility files, states can free up dollars for care and modernization. With a transparent and respectful process, states can build member trust. Finally, strong community engagement verification processes can become ready frameworks for future eligibility initiatives.To realize this added value, start with the fundamentals of an effective approach to community engagement verification:Member-First Design. When auto-verification is not available, member self-attestation workflows should be mobile-friendly, multilingual, and status-tracked in real time. This can reduce call-center spikes as well as the frustration that leads to unnecessary churn. Omnichannel Outreach. Meet members on their terms to drive engagement and compliance. Outreach through multiple channels including text, email, IVR, mail, and high- touch case worker interactions. From there, capture documentation once to avoid redundant uploads and lost PDFs.Data-Enabled Verification. Reduce the onus of verification on members and applicants by ingesting multiple data sources (wage, university, volunteerism, etc.). This enables quick and seamless auto-verification, avoiding human error and ensuring accuracy.Continuous Visibility. Create a data-driven picture of community engagement verification. Use dashboards and dynamic visualization to understand verification rates by region, demographics, and MCO to redeploy outreach budgets where they matter most.AI-Enabled Workflows. Integrate AI to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse, streamline end-to-end processes, and increase accuracy in determination.Cost-Conscious Procurement. Lower upfront costs and optimized operational costs to achieve state objectives.Get Started: Top Priorities for TodayWith such a tight timeline and so much at stake, it can be overwhelming to know where to start with community engagement verification. We recommend that states prioritize four key actions:Decide on state-specific objectives. Identify what additional state specific objectives need to be achieved in addition to compliance (e.g., additional outreach, referrals.)Select the right partners. Choose data partners with a national footprint and proven Medicaid scale to avoid piloting on members’ backs.Develop meaningful KPIs. Set KPIs that matter, (e.g., ensure 90% of targeted members are verified within 60 days, with less than a specified percentage of improper disenrollments, and hold stakeholders accountable.)Consult with partners. Work with partners that have done eligibility verification work in the past as there have been many lessons learned that can mitigate mistakes and maximize results.H.R. 1 turned community engagement from concept to mandate. Now, all eyes are on states to implement community engagement verification. Challenges exist, and the timeline is tight. But there are also opportunities for states to put members at the center and leverage data-driven processes to meet two critical goals: complying with the mandate and strengthening the Medicaid program for members.

Improving Health Outcomes and Program Effectiveness for Justice-Involved Populations | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Improving Health Outcomes and Program Effectiveness for Justice-Involved Populations March 31, 2025A platform-based approach using data and analytics to drive measurable impact People lose their Medicaid coverage when they are incarcerated. They have to reapply after release just as they are working to successfully transition back to community life. This population faces challenges such as housing instability, establishing employment, and management of complex conditions. The reapplication process and determination of eligibility can be burdensome, resulting in delays in accessing clinical care, medications, and support services. These impacts not only compromise members’ health outcomes but also contribute to higher healthcare costs and increased risks of recidivism. For the state Medicaid agencies coordinating services for justice-involved individuals, leveraging analytics and insights can improve health outcomes while optimizing the cost of care and improving program effectiveness. Justice-Involved Programs: Data and Analytics are Key Most incarcerated individuals are eligible for Medicaid post release—and many have complicating health issues. Justice-involved individuals are at disproportionately high risk for poor health outcomes. In addition to having chronic diseases, many report mental health concerns, and substance use disorders are common. For people leaving incarceration, these health concerns are in addition to pressing needs such as housing, employment, education, and transportation. Limited access to healthcare can worsen health and influence higher rates of recidivism. This is why justice-involved programs are essential to improving health outcomes while containing costs. Data, analytics, and interconnectivity underpin effective justice-involved programs. This powerful trio is also critical to overcoming common barriers, which include identifying and enrolling individuals and enabling care managers, community-based-organizations, and others to provide the necessary help. When creating a justice-involved program, a primary goal should be reducing costs without sacrificing quality. It is critical to co-develop a holistic vision with the broader community, build a common, secure data backbone, integrate closely with existing systems, and ensure that the platform can support the full justice-involved journey. These best practices help to expand access for individuals transitioning from incarceration by supporting continuity of care, reducing coverage gaps, and supporting successful reintegration. At the same time, states have the data insights they need to reduce avoidable expenses, assess program effectiveness, and support value-based care models. Addressing the Needs of Justice-Involved Individuals CMS and States are Taking Action Governments and states are increasingly taking proactive measures to support justice-involved populations. For example, Congress recently passed bipartisan legislation that includes several changes to Medicaid policy for justice-involved populations. These provisions include suspending rather than terminating Medicaid coverage during incarceration, using state grants to build operational capacity. Taken together, these changes could help improve incarceration transition and the overall health of justice-involved populations. The Incarceration Transition Healthcare Journey There are three primary phases to the incarceration transition healthcare journey — pre-release, transition, and post-release. A successful justice-involved program includes a highly targeted set of capabilities for each phase. 1. Pre-Release Phase Identify and Enroll in/Activate Medicaid To-be-released individuals are identified, and their Medicaid (and other program) eligibility is assessed. If eligible, they are enrolled (or activated if suspended). At time of incarceration, a determination is made about whether Medicaid enrollment should be suspended, based on Medicaid regulations. Key Challenges Securely accessing and integrating key datasets, such as correctional facility release schedule, eligibility and enrollment, and Medicaid information Seamlessly enrolling/activating Medicaid and if it is not already in place, suspending Medicaid as appropriate upon incarceration 2. Transition Phase Support People Through Their Transition The first step of the transition phase is to assign a care manager or case manager to coordinate medical and supporting services for the transition. The care manager conducts a comprehensive assessment to identify members’ specific needs and determine the required care and services. Based on this assessment, the care manager develops a care and transition plan that covers events like discharge, post-discharge primary care visit, and other necessary medical or behavioral health appointments. Additionally, the care manager helps coordinate the facility discharge process, including ensuring prescription fulfillment and connecting members with essential support services. To enable integrated care, states need a secure and connected data platform that allows care coordination and information sharing. This includes care planning information, analytics to assess service needs and coverage, and solutions to identify appropriate, cost-effective care and support options. A well-designed platform facilitates seamless collaboration among healthcare providers, community-based organizations, correctional facilities, and other key stakeholders involved in the transition process. Key Challenges Addressing workforce-related issues Collaborating on care plans across multiple organizations Finding providers and community-support organizations to support people post release due to a lack of closed-loop referrals 3. Post-Release Phase Helping People Navigate the System Navigating the healthcare system is hard, especially for post-release individuals who have challenges and adjustments to manage during and immediately after leaving incarceration. They can also have a higher prevalence of healthcare, behavioral health, and substance-abuse conditions. To help people during this critical time, states need robust care management strategies. Whether through managed care organizations, health homes, contracted partners, or state-led initiatives, it’s essential to identify the appropriate providers and community-based organizations, coordinate scheduling, and ensure closed-loop referrals to deliver the required services. Key Challenges The post-release phase is unique, and the underlying platform can make or break the success of post-release care. The platform should support: Collaborative development of individualized care plans Identification and scheduling of appointments (with closed-loop referrals) with providers and community-based organizations Secure access to relevant patient information to maximize the impact of care delivered Beyond the platform and data, successful programs focus extensively on engaging stakeholders — such as correctional facilities, community-based organizations, state agencies, and providers — to ensure that the platform and overall program is tailored to the community’s needs. Community Information Exchanges (CIEs) play an important role in post-release care, helping members connect with key services such as healthcare, behavioral health, housing, and social support. When looking for a partner in this area, find one that engages with leading CIE solutions providers. Together, they can develop integrated solutions that combine both core CIE services, such as service matching with foundational capabilities including data interoperability, longitudinal patient records, and collaborative care planning. Justice-Involved Platform Components A number of organizations have conducted research and developed best practices to inform justice-involved programs. The Commonwealth Fund developed a potential care model that, when enabled with an underlying platform, can support people after release. The Fundamentals Implementing a Justice-Involved Platform This is a unique population with unique needs. While every state has nuanced issues to address, these fundamentals apply broadly. Cast a Wide Net for Support:Successfully developing a justice-involved program requires support from many stakeholders across the healthcare and social support sectors. These programs engage a broad set of stakeholders in setting the vision, design, and deployment, then tightly integrating this engagement with platform design. Set the Vision, Build Toward It: Setting a clear vision inspires people and provides direction to all organizations required to make the program successful. Implementing the full vision will take time. Effective implementation planning can demonstrate impact, achieve success, and sustain momentum for the broader program and vision. Prepare for Sharing Data: Helping justice-involved members receive the necessary care and support requires reliable access to medical, behavioral, and community services. Accurately updating the members’ healthcare records and status ensures continuity of care. Doing this requires a secure, interoperable, broad, and readily accessible data layer to support multiple data types. Expect a Ripple Effect of Change: Significant changes will be required to Medicaid and other state systems and process. It will be important to deeply integrate with or build upon existing systems and operational infrastructure to get the desired results. Avoid False Tradeoffs:State leaders often think they must choose between innovation and experience – that they either must work with small technology companies that provide point solutions or large companies that work with states on large-scale implementations.

Transforming Provider Experiences: Navigating the Journey with Confidence | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Transforming Provider Experiences: Navigating the Journey with Confidence May 28, 2025(4 of 4)(In this fourth and final installment of our series on Provider Experiences, we focus on using provider feedback to continually innovate.) Providers’ needs are constantly evolving, and Medicaid agencies must adapt their systems and processes accordingly. Advanced analytics and self-service tools create a feedback loop that helps translate insights into innovation. For example, analysis of calls interacting with a secure AI-powered conversational voicebot or chatbot can help organizations understand inquiry types and transfer points. This data informs them of opportunities to expand self-service capabilities or improve the system, ensuring members and providers get what they need faster and easier.Engaging Providers in the Product Development ProcessThe best experiences are created when providers are invited into the development process. It is recommended that vendor partners employ various strategies to engage providers at this stage, including hosting provider user groups and continually involving providers and state leaders in the iterative process. This collaboration enables providers to practice at the top of their licenses.Innovation and Service: The Foundation of Exceptional Provider ExperiencesInnovation and service are foundational to exceptional provider experiences. Vendors or agency departments that offer white glove approaches deliver continuous support through technology-enabled interactions and personal, in-office assistance, identifying opportunities to reduce administrative complexity for providers and staff.For instance, centralized credentialing can reduce the administrative burden on providers by replacing the separate credentialing processes for each Medicaid MCO with a single credentialing process for the entire state. Vastly reducing the burden on providers erases a significant barrier to entry that causes network adequacy issues and is a source of provider frustration. Nor does this centralized process need to end at state boundaries; regional (and even national) credentialing can allow states to significantly reduce expenses by sharing cost and particularly benefits providers and beneficiaries near state borders.Reducing Complexity, Improving LivesMedicaid providers are driven by the desire to positively impact their communities. They shouldn’t have to choose between this commitment and the administrative burden of participating in the Medicaid program. Advances in technology and ways of working have made processing claims reliable and like-real-time, and the provider experience is on the brink of a similar reinvention.The Path ForwardTo drive change, state Medicaid agencies need intelligent provider solutions, human-centered design, and feedback loops that account for providers’ shifting needs. The moment has arrived. Agencies have the motivation to embrace this innovation, and industry-leading tools, technologies, and approaches provide the way.Creating a Best-in-Class Provider Experience with GainwellA streamlined provider experience is best achieved by eliminating bureaucratic obstacles, leveraging CMS enrollments and data, implementing a prior authorization gold card process, and enhancing technological and operational efficiencies.Improving provider experiences is about making thoughtful, strategic adjustments that address the entire journey. By focusing on these key strategies, agencies can create a more efficient, satisfying, and empowering experience for providers, ultimately leading to better outcomes for all.

MES Vendor Strategy: Three Essentials When Consolidating IT and Business Operations | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: MES Vendor Strategy: Three Essentials When Consolidating IT and Business Operations May 16, 2025For state Medicaid agencies, managing complex multivendor ecosystems can be costly, time consuming, and inefficient. As states work to streamline costs and improve outcomes, they are exploring opportunities to simplify and rationalize their Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) ecosystems.With fewer vendors and well-defined “swim lanes” of roles and responsibilities, a state can take control of costs, accelerate turnaround times, and more readily adopt innovations from analytics to automation.One such strategy is the consolidation of IT and business operations support. With fewer vendors to manage, a state can reduce its administrative burden and redirect resources to more mission-critical activities. On the vendor side, having a single, integrated team to run IT and business operations significantly improves communication and accelerates lead time, enabling greater agility in meeting daily requirements and responding to regulatory and market dynamics.While such benefits are compelling, the decision to streamline a vendor ecosystem requires careful deliberation. How can a state be sure vendors are equipped not just to keep the proverbial lights on, but also to spark and sustain innovation over time?Experience points to a “three-legged stool” of essential capabilities: knowledge of the system, relevant operational and technical skills at scale, and a mature delivery model.1. Knowledge of the systemWhen consolidating IT and business operations support, consider the experience and knowledge of the current business operations vendor. Few individuals know an MES better than the people who spend their days using it to deliver this support. That builds deep familiarity and knowledge in how the system functions, including its strengths and opportunities for improvement. As such, a state’s current business operations vendor is uniquely positioned to collaborate with IT resources dedicated to ongoing system support and enhancement.2. Relevant operational and technical skills at scaleA vendor that is taking over both business operations and IT must possess expertise in the architecture, language, and other technical aspects of the legacy MES. This expertise must be backed by IT talent that can scale to the diverse resource needs of a large and complex state. Depending on how an MES was developed and on which type of technology, it is critical to secure the right set of expertise.Equally important is a track record of success in managing both IT and business operations for Medicaid programs across the United States. It’s essential to collaborate with a vendor that has a proven methodology for migrating and managing support for both business operations and IT.3. Mature delivery modelFinally, a vendor must be able to demonstrate proven best practices for communication and collaboration, offering full transparency into the IT and business operations support being delivered.A mature delivery model should incorporate a shared services approach that aligns resources for optimal efficiency and outcomes while maintaining some critical resources dedicated to the organization. In addition, when a state entrusts both business operations and IT support to a single, experienced vendor, that company can dramatically simplify how routine work gets done and how quickly and efficiently the state can adapt to new regulatory mandates. The right vendor can ensure faster processes and added convenience for Medicaid members and providers to get the support they need.Strengthening stability to power innovationChoosing vendors that deliver against all three of these requirements increases the possibility that a state will achieve its desired outcomes. And while the stability provided by this three-legged stool is critical to keeping an MES running smoothly, it’s also a prerequisite for continued innovation.Beyond the three core requirements, look for vendors with a demonstrated commitment to collaboration and experience in applying innovation in a modular fashion. For example, there may be opportunities to add a provider management module to address goals for better provider experience and higher operational excellence. In addition, targeted automations that help reduce manual processes and error rates can yield cost reductions along with improved experience for multiple stakeholders. Similarly, insights from AI-driven analytics can help pinpoint specific opportunities to enhance performance and service delivery, enabling a state to unlock further efficiencies and innovations. Choose wiselyRationalizing an MES ecosystem, including consolidating IT and business operations support, is a highly strategic decision. With the right choice, a state can meet its goals for controlling costs, enhancing experience, and improving outcomes.

Building a Data-Driven Care Ecosystem: Five Lessons for Medicaid Leaders | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Building a Data-Driven Care Ecosystem: Five Lessons for Medicaid Leaders March 20, 2025A unified approach to coordinated care is essential for improving health outcomes for populations and driving value for state and commercial healthcare sectors. When it comes to operationalizing state-specific programs, however, there are a number of factors for leaders to consider in building an effective and sustainable infrastructure for their initiatives. What’s happening in California offers valuable lessons and a successful model to follow.California’s Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) launched CalAIM’s population health management program as a coordinated, statewide approach to improving clinical outcomes and quality of life for Medi-Cal members. It focuses on wellness, prevention, and care coordination across healthcare delivery organizations and community partners.The goal? To create a healthcare system that works for all Californians.Holistic Healthcare Requires Holistic DataAn ambitious initiative like this requires extensive collaboration. The way the healthcare ecosystem works together for members will change in exciting and profound ways. And data is the cornerstone of it all.This is why Medi-Cal Connect is such an important part of Medi-Cal’s program transformation. This pioneering data solution aggregates specific ecosystem partner data for a comprehensive picture of members’ health and benefits. It also provides population-level insight to shape programs and policy decisions.Not Your Traditional ImplementationAs the team implementing Medi-Cal Connect in partnership with DHCS, we’re excited about how it can improve healthcare, enhance care coordination, and reduce healthcare costs across California. Drawing from our experience, there are invaluable lessons for other states as they develop their program approaches.At a fundamental level, making progress toward efficient, whole person care will require agencies to go beyond traditional procurement and implementation approaches designed for transactional systems and fit-for-purpose solutions.Here are five lessons to consider for implementing impactful state-specific policies and programs:1. Shift from a Big-Bang to a Start-Small Implementation MindsetSupporting population health goals can seem like an everything-all-at-once undertaking. It’s complex, comprehensive, and nuanced. States also face the pressure of quickly demonstrating progress and outcomes. Even so, resist the temptation to approach your program initiatives with a big-bang mindset that doesn’t allow for flexibility.An incremental approach has served California well. It allows state agencies to pilot and refine solutions while improving coordination with key partners when required. It’s about working at a pace and scale that ensures the ecosystem has the grounding to make the most of the solution. There is room for experimentation and refinement — and you can bring stakeholders along the journey. Start with what you can do relatively easily and build momentum from there.2. Build Data Literacy Capacity Across All UsersData is the foundation of program enablement, and data literacy is a critical factor for success in improving care coordination, increasing value-based payments, and enhancing program oversight. This involves more than training individuals to use a new dashboard; it requires introducing a range of competencies to workforces across various organizations. Starting with how data is sourced, aggregated, and normalized, program analytics require a transition from a regulatory and reporting approach to data to using data to enable insights. This necessitates cross-disciplinary collaboration to address data silos and build trust in data that has been transformed for healthcare insights.Consider data literacy an organizational skill. Unite the data team with those designing your program to foster a shared understanding of optimal service use from various perspectives such as programmatic, technical, operational, and human.3. Think Broadly in Developing the Change Management StrategyStrong governance is key to change management in a statewide program initiative. In California, DHCS made it a priority early on. From the start, ensure that all critical parts of your organization understand the vision and have a shared sense of ownership. A framework with defined roles and responsibilities enables individuals to effectively contribute their unique expertise. Don’t underestimate the scope of change management needed for this type of initiative. Change management needs extend beyond the walls of your agency to managed care organizations, providers, community-based partners, and members themselves.4. Engage Stakeholders Around Value — Early and OftenWe have been relentless about considering stakeholder impact. There is no single organization that addresses all the healthcare and social needs of Medi-Cal members. DHCS, managed care plans, and social services, and behavioral health agencies all play vital roles, each with unique requirements.Engage stakeholders early to assess their needs and collaboratively shape solutions that align with the state’s broader healthcare strategy. This approach allows for the development of tailored value propositions. It’s essential that stakeholders do not perceive new tools as additional burdens, but rather as valuable resources that can be integrated seamlessly into existing workflows to enhance outcomes for members.5. Center and Recenter Around Member OutcomesDHCS ensures we keep members as our touchstone. We encourage you to do the same. While addressing challenges and milestones is important, stay focused on your core purpose. Rally your team and stakeholders around your vision and realign around it regularly and passionately.The journey towards effective care at scale is multifaceted, requiring strategic alignment and collaboration across various efforts. By adopting a start-small implementation approach, fostering data literacy as an organizational competency, implementing robust change management strategies, actively engaging stakeholders, and continually prioritizing member outcomes, you can establish a resilient foundation that can adapt and thrive amidst the complexities of healthcare delivery. By staying committed to these principles, we can ensure each initiative not only meets its objectives but also advances the overarching goal of improving health outcomes for your members and lowering the total cost of care.Contact us to learn more about our work on Medi-Cal Connect, or to start a conversation on how we can support your goals.

Unlocking Medicaid-Based Solutions to Support Health Related Social Needs for Homeless Populations & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Three Keys to Better Outcomes for Populations Experiencing Homelessness February 1, 2024Across the country, a silent storm is raging. Millions of people are grappling with homelessness — a complex issue intertwined with health disparities and chronic health conditions. While Medicaid has long played a crucial role in supporting clinical needs of unhoused populations, a critical health-related social need has remained largely unaddressed: stable housing.Enter Section 1115 waivers and their potential to transform how states address people’s social needs — including the fundamental need for shelter.With Section 1115 waiver authority, states can add certain non-clinical services to the benefits they offer to Medicaid members. Approved for 18 states in 2022, these waivers open the door to home and community-based services (HCBS) to address housing instability in vulnerable populations. The future is promising. However, a crucial gap looms: the lack of robust data analytics to help shape and guide these new programs.Such data analytics are within reach, as evidenced by recent work in supporting better services and outcomes for members with severe and persistent mental illness. Gainwell’s experience in architecting evidence-based solutions points to three keys to unlocking the value of analytics in service of better outcomes.Harness the Power of HMIS DataAt the heart of effective housing interventions lies HUD’s Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). This treasure trove of data is critical to understanding the demographics, challenges and trajectories of homeless populations. By applying the right analytics engine to HMIS data, it becomes possible to build a foundation for designing, executing and continually improving housing-related supports. Use HMIS to inform:Population needs. Identify high-risk groups struggling with housing instability and tailor interventions accordingly.Resource allocation. Pinpoint areas with underserved populations to optimize program reach and impact.Outcome tracking. Measure the effectiveness of interventions and make data-driven adjustments for continuous improvement.Weave a Holistic Web of DataThough powerful, HMIS data is a single thread in a complex tapestry. States also need the ability to integrate HMIS data with other relevant datasets to create a more complete picture of each individual and their environment. Such datasets include:Medicaid claims data, which helps illuminate the health conditions and service utilization patterns of people experiencing homelessness. These insights enable targeted interventions that address both housing and healthcare needs.Social determinants of health data. These data sources help to uncover broader factors contributing to homelessness — such as poverty, food insecurity and mental health challenges — and support the development of more comprehensive, multi-pronged approaches.Build a Blueprint for TransformationUsing data analytics to construct more effective whole-person interventions isn’t a one-time project. It’s an ongoing effort that benefits from a well-constructed plan. At Gainwell, we start by working to understand the unique needs of each state and its target population. From there, we can create a customized analytics framework that guides program implementation, tracks progress and informs policy decisions. A transformation blueprint should cover the following elements:Predictive modeling. Identify individuals at risk of homelessness to enable interventions before they fall through the cracks.Real-time reporting. Equip states with up-to-date information on program performance to support course correction and resource optimization.Data visualization. Present complex data in clear, actionable dashboards, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.For states and their citizens experiencing homelessness, the opportunity is immense. Data analytics can and should become the tool states rely on to build effective and enduring solutions to housing instability within Medicaid-eligible populations.

What’s New in Coordination of Benefits |  & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: What Makes a Coordination of Benefits Program Best in Class? January 2, 2024Ron SinghPurpose-driven innovation, industry expertise and a relentless pursuit of excellence are the raw ingredients that fuel any “best in class” program. These same attributes drive the  team to continually revolutionize coordination of benefits (COB) for Medicaid programs.Nearly 40 years ago, our business leaders first collaborated with both state and federal governments to pioneer the Medicaid Third Party Liability (TPL) program. From those early beginnings, the industry has continued to evolve and TPL programs now preserve billions of taxpayer dollars in annual Medicaid savings. By remaining the payer of last resort, Medicaid is best positioned to deliver its mission of providing safety net healthcare services to vulnerable children and adults. As a partner on that journey, Gainwell has consistently provided our Medicaid-sponsored clients with the necessary expertise and ingenuity to help meet their goals.I am enthusiastic about the leadership position that Gainwell has earned since we implemented the country’s first outsourced TPL program in 1985. COB is complex, and as the healthcare industry has evolved, the need for business partners that provide legislative support, technology enablement and healthcare data insight is critical to attain program success. Our Gainwell team continually meets the challenge to identify opportunities that make our clients’ unique COB/TPL programs operate with agility, accuracy and speed. Our ability to execute these initiatives means that Medicaid dollars are optimized.Big Data + Advanced Analytics = Impressive ResultsIdentifying other coverage available to Medicaid members — whether from commercial payers, TRICARE or Medicare — is the foundation of any effective COB program. But basic demographic matching has become increasingly challenging because of HIPAA regulations limiting the use of SSNs, proprietary carrier membership formats and the proliferation of benefits managers. Recognizing the need for more advanced capabilities to identify Medicaid members with other coverage, Gainwell developed a Big Data-driven approach to coverage identification.First, we invested in developing an enterprise Master Member Index that aggregates longitudinal data on over 300 million unique individuals, including eligibility, claim and demographic attributes. These records are continually refreshed and augmented with national demographic and other data sources to ensure optimal accuracy. Our data augmentation, cleansing and enhancements of the Master Member Index enables us to increase TPL identification up to 20% over standard industry matching results.At the same time, our member-centric approach to TPL identification enables us to leverage artificial intelligence in order to identify gaps in coverage that we encounter. By marrying our team of data scientists with the rich eligibility and demographic data assets that we maintain (including the Master Member Index), Gainwell is able to predict coverages held by a member, which we then confirm with carriers directly. As a result, we can rapidly create and deliver a comprehensive member insurance profile to our clients so that they minimize their payment exposure across all potential claim types.Predicting Claim Recovery Outcomes with Machine LearningOwing to its size, Medicaid often covers a broad base of services, expansive provider networks and generous formularies. Yet when pursuing recovery on TPL claims, liable third parties may reject claims for any of these reasons.Gainwell’s experience processing over $80 billion in TPL claims monthly has yielded a wealth of historical data that we use to assess a Medicaid claim’s probability of payment from a liable commercial insurer. Harnessing technological power and machine learning, we incorporate these past billing outcomes into our algorithms in order to score each outgoing claim we bill on our client’s behalf. Through this scoring, we predict a claim’s likelihood of being paid, the expected payment amount and even the carrier’s anticipated processing time.Gainwell’s ability to accurately score each claim helps us to prioritize our subsequent recovery optimization efforts and focus on claims with the highest likelihood of payment. At the same time, we provide insights to our customers on how best to configure their claims adjudication systems to optimize both pre-payment and post-payment cost containment efforts.COB: Work SmarterFor every administrator of a Medicaid program, enforcing TPL is a requirement. For any program that wants to operate with greater efficiency and effectiveness, Gainwell’s best-in-class capabilities are a must-have.If you’d like to learn how your organization can benefit from Gainwell innovations resulting from our relentless pursuit of advancing COB/TPL outcomes, please contact us.

Medicaid Modernization: Aligning Business Strategy with Human Outcomes | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Medicaid Modernization: Aligning Business Strategy with Human Outcomes June 21, 2024Imagine embarking on a cross-country road trip without a destination in mind. You’ve got maps, snacks and a full tank of gas, but where are you going? Similarly, as states gear up to modernize Medicaid, jumping into creating a tech roadmap is like planning that trip without knowing the destination. Modernizing health and human services is crucial for meeting federal mandates and adapting to the evolving needs of communities. Yet, it’s not just about picking the latest tech for the journey.Determining the Optimal EndpointAt Gainwell, we’re seeing states find the greatest success when they align their Medicaid IT modernization roadmaps to the end results they desire in their overall Medicaid programs. Closely examining existing business processes, identifying opportunities for optimization and employing technology as the enabler ensures that systems and operations are aligned toward program outcomes. Just as the starting point is different for every state, so is the destination. No one route will lead every state to the same outcome. Rather, state-specific business needs and priorities will determine the best path forward. These business needs vary from program to program, but there are some common themes and trends we’re seeing that are driving the need for technological enhancements across Medicaid programs. These considerations, in turn, are helping states determine where to focus their modernization efforts. The shift from fee-for-service to managed and value-based care. Most Medicaid systems were originally developed to handle large volumes of fee-for-service claims, but states that are shifting to managed care and value-based care models may need to either modernize their existing systems or replace them with newer technologies. The shift toward integrated, patient-focused care models, utilizing capitation and incentive-based payments, has states reevaluating their current claims processing systems. Self-service and user experience. States can improve member engagement, drive higher use and create greater user satisfaction by enhancing member- and provider-facing portals and user interfaces. It’s a high-impact effort with moderate investment, that can transform the digital user experience.Focus on the person. As states work to improve health outcomes at population scale, they must equip systems to accommodate multi-source data and perform advanced analytics. This will enable the creation of longitudinal health records that support preventive, actionable and measurable interventions. Asking Strategic QuestionsIdentifying desired outcomes at the outset of a modernization initiative and asking questions about how best to achieve these goals will help ensure alignment throughout the project. Since these goals are specific to each state, modernization approaches will vary. Define near- and long-term outcomes to better serve citizens and improve healthcare interactions, while at the same time optimizing existing systems and effectively allocating resources. What do you want to accomplish for your beneficiaries, and what will get you there? Prioritize these outcomes. Which will deliver the highest impact? Which are the most attainable? Prioritizing desired outcomes will help inform your roadmap, reduce risk and keep you driving toward your goals. Evaluate options to determine the best approach for your enterprise. What business areas are your biggest challenges, and how could new technologies support progress? What is your desired timeline and budget for achieving outcomes? Transforming for the FutureModernizing current systems and processes is essential to the evolution and sustainability of state Medicaid programs and their ability to meet the needs of members today and in the future. Modernization is inevitable.From the very outset, states will have the greatest success if they think of modernization not as a technology project, but as true, outcomes-based transformation. This will get you not only to your destination, but also set you up for continuous improvement over the long term.For a more in-depth look at Medicaid modernization, read Gainwell’s white paper, Modernizing Medicaid: An Outcomes-Based Roadmap.

The Hidden Power of Immunization Registries |  & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: The Hidden Power of Immunization Registries November 16, 2022Tonya Philbrick-LabbeIn my last post, I talked about the importance of using immunization registries to increase vaccination rates and improve public health. Today, I’d like to focus on the future of these systems, and why their evolution is so important.What Are Immunization Information Systems? Immunization information systems (IIS), often called immunization registries (IR), first appeared in the early 1990s. Since then, they’ve been making patients’ immunization data increasingly useful, but we’re far from realizing their full utility.IIS offer a wide range of benefits. They consolidate data into a single record that’s easily accessible by providers and parents, avoid duplicate vaccinations, reduce administrative work tracking down immunization history from other providers and make it easy to provide required information to daycare, schools and other institutions.All good things. But when fully utilized, these systems can do so much more — they become powerful tools that can advance the quadruple aim of improving the patient experience, achieving better health outcomes, improving the clinician experience and lowering the cost of care.IIS ModernizationMost states and providers are interested in updating their legacy systems that were built more than 20 years ago using now-outdated code and hardware. Machines with limited capacity sitting in a server room in a state office building can’t compare to a modern, fast and secure cloud-based solution that’s easily expanded, has near infinite capacity and can quickly be configured to exchange data with other systems.Registries: Not Just for Kids Any MoreHistorically, most IIS have focused on tracking children’s immunizations, and that’s where the majority of funding goes. COVID-19, however, showed us the very real value of using these systems to record adult vaccinations. It also showed us that most current systems are overburdened, and they struggled to keep up with the additional load.Every state currently operates an IIS that is capable of tracking adult immunizations, yet data is available for only about 60% of adults compared to 95% of children.The CDC is invested in ensuring state registries can track vaccination status for all Americans, young and old. They are working with the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA) to address gaps in current systems and practices. One component of this partnership is the “Landscape Analysis Report,” which presents a comprehensive view of the current adult vaccination environment. It examines practices, policies, challenges and successes. The report will be used to create a roadmap which will recommend strategies to improve provider use of IIS for adults. The report recommends the following:Capture of adult data must be a priority from the national level to the clinical setting, with adequate funding and staffing.Providers need motivation to comply with adult requirements. This could come from mandates, fiscal incentives, information campaigns, pressure from patients and peers, and tools that make reporting a part of their daily workflow.There must be automated data exchange between IIS and EHRs, without opt-in requirements.Confidence must be built amongst providers regarding data accuracy and quality.The federal government has also made increasing the number of people captured in IIS an objective in its Healthy People 2030 plan.The Time Is NowThis is the perfect time to modernize, expand and integrate these systems. COVID-19 provided both funds and motivation to improve IIS, but we still need to address inter-state interoperability, data standardization and minimum capture requirements.Interoperability and Data StandardizationThe lack of interoperability between states’ systems severely limits their potential value.Consider the following scenario: A child is born in one state, then, years later, the family moves to another. The child gets older and goes away to college in a third state, then moves to a fourth for work … and so on. Each move between states currently means a blank slate in the IIS.What’s needed is a comprehensive record that captures data throughout a person’s life, no matter the state or place of service, whether that’s a primary care provider, pharmacist, school or other setting.Can Immunization Registries Address Social Determinants of Health?IIS, in general, currently do a good job of identifying pockets and communities of the under-vaccinated. But if modernized, the hidden power of these systems would be uncovered.Through collaboration with state health authorities, registries would allow identification of the social determinants of health that are impeding a patient, or a community, from receiving vaccinations. This could mitigate the barriers that are affecting not just immunization rates, but community health in general.What’s Next?Bringing immunization registries into the 21st century is exciting, but unlocking their full potential will take visionary thinking and purposeful collaboration at all levels of health and human services. It’s a great opportunity, and investment made today will create a healthier future for everyone.

​​​Integrating Medicaid & Referral Data: Holistic Insights Driving Improved Outcomes | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: ​​​Integrating Medicaid & Referral Data: Holistic Insights Driving Improved Outcomes October 9, 2024By: Mina Nemirow, Senior Director, Product Development,  Kim Butler, Analytics Lead and EDW Product Manager,  Chris Dunkin, Director, Government Markets, Findhelp The need for state Medicaid agencies to ​assess and address ​the gaps in ​Health-Related Social Needs (HRSN)/Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) is growing. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has expanded the scope of Section 1115 waivers, which offer new opportunities to design, research, and pilot programs to measurably improve the health of Medicaid enrollees. In some cases, the federal government is requiring states to track and report on HRSN data as part of Medicaid waiver approvals. Beyond federal mandates, state Medicaid agencies have an unprecedented opportunity to measure the effectiveness of their programs. However, many lack integrated data from ​ ​HRSN ​initiatives ​and are not leveraging analytics to identify which unmet needs are related to members’ health outcomes, in what ways, and at what cost. GainwellGenius Analytics, in conjunction with Findhelp, can identify and address unmet social needs that drive chronic conditions. Unmet needs can lead to gaps in coverage and access to care, increased downstream medical costs, poorer health outcomes, and the continuation of health disparities. This is especially true for children and adults at high risk for adverse health outcomes, and individuals in historically underserved communities. Closing these gaps can lead to better care coordination, simpler administrative processes, and more precise program targeting and reporting. Gaining New Levels of Visibility through Data Historically, Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS) have not housed data on social needs assessments and closed-loop HRSN referrals. Integrating this information through claims and encounters data via ICD-10 “Z codes” unlocks the potential to identify which social support programs are having a positive impact on target Medicaid populations and which are affecting health-related costs. Such visibility enables accountability and collaboration across the spectrum of health and social care, from service delivery to reimbursement. Acting on Impactful Insights Robust data and analytics toolsets enable state Medicaid agencies to measure the progress of initiatives and make data-driven decisions about where to focus their efforts. Gainwell, the leading provider of MMIS and Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) solutions, is teaming with ​Findhelp, the top-rated social care referral and tracking platform, to provide agencies with the ability to​ measure the impact of HRSN programs and interventions, as well as the performance of health plans and providers to improve the quality of life and experience of Medicaid members. ​​Gainwell and Findhelp are collaborating to address states’ need to measure the effectiveness and outcomes of implementing 1115 ​waivers and closed loop referral systems. By utilizing the ​HRSN assessment, ​referral and tracking data from Findhelp, combined with claims/encounters data from Gainwell systems, provides insight into which social support programs are impacting health-related costs and which upstream programs are positively impacting target Medicaid populations. Further, the system tracks performance of health plans and providers in conducting social needs assessments​ and connecting members to HRSN programs​ — holding these entities accountable for ensuring members receive the social support services they need. ​​Through this innovative approach, Medicaid agencies can improve care coordination, streamline administrative processes, and provide better program targeting and reporting. Additionally, near real-time data will reveal HRSN gaps, allowing states to decipher which HRSN social programs have measurably impacted member health status. The result: A more informed, efficient, and comprehensive approach to member care.

Using AI in Medicaid Claim Reviews & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Using AI in Medicaid Claim Reviews July 11, 2023Gary Call, M.D.Artificial intelligence (AI) is designed to make life better for humans, but many worry it will have the opposite effect. A survey by Pew Research, for example, shows that people fear being displaced by technology and ultimately surrendering autonomy and control. It’s an understandable reaction, given the depictions of AI in popular culture. Many entertaining — if unrealistic — storylines have centered around sentient computers wreaking havoc while malicious robots rule the world.It seems that movie directors have yet to seize upon the most exciting and compelling scenario of all: using AI to review Medicaid claims for billing errors.From Fiction to FactAI has already found its way into nearly every industry, including Medicaid. Far from displacing humans, AI is actually benefiting them in multiple ways. For one thing, AI is working alongside humans to make their jobs more efficient. And rather than creating friction, AI can be instrumental in fostering better relationships.Let’s look at the area of cost containment, where Medicaid programs are charged with being good stewards of public funds. Robust payment integrity initiatives are vital in combating fraud, waste and abuse. Payment integrity programs ensure that claims are medically necessary and correctly submitted, and this is where clinical claim reviews come in.At their most basic, clinical claim reviews identify claims that were billed or coded in error. The reviews can be conducted in a pre-pay or post-pay environment, and a final determination is performed by an expert clinician.With the introduction of automation, clinical claim reviews take payment integrity to the next level by adding predictive analytics. Incoming data is analyzed by combining machine learning (ML) technology with historical data for improved accuracy. When Gainwell performs claim reviews, for instance, we rely on more than 10 petabytes of historical data, based on more than 15 years of medical record reviews. When combined with proprietary ML, this data can be used to create algorithms that easily identify the claims most likely to have errors. Now, here’s where science fiction becomes science fact. With the use of ML and AI, algorithms constantly improve and get more efficient at targeting erroneous claims. In other words, they not only help to speed the process, but they also continually work to make clinical claim review solutions become even smarter.The Human ConnectionUnlike movie storylines, however, humans are not eliminated in the claim review scenario. In fact, they play extremely important roles.First, the fine-tuning of algorithms is not accomplished by AI alone. It is actually driven by a synergy between AI and the collective knowledge of data scientists and clinical experts. Without human input, AI can only go so far.Next, when a human touch is needed, clinical experts can step in to personally review records. These experts can be physicians, nurses, certified coders, dentists or behavioral health professionals, all of whom have the experience and insight necessary to determine whether fraud, waste and abuse are at play.And here’s one of the best benefits. AI can actually be used to improve human experiences. Used correctly, AI can speed the payment process and actually reduce provider abrasion, saving time, money and frustration. Adding Innovation to the ProcessWhen claims can be given an initial review without the associated medical records, a giant stumbling block is removed. The process not only accelerates, but the experience becomes smoother for both payers and providers. The potential for AI to assist is so intriguing that Gainwell chose to test a concept called Intelligent Review as part of our Clinical Claim Reviews solution.The Intelligent Review process employs predictive models that use data attribute sequencing to analyze combinations of elements within a claim, such as length of stay, diagnosis codes, procedure codes, discharge status and age, as well as provider-specific billing and performance patterns. Algorithms drive the selection process, comparing each sequence to historical outcomes.Using hierarchal selection, Intelligent Review sends claims with the highest overpayment potential through clinical review without requesting medical records. Each claim is finalized by a clinician before the provider is notified of a preliminary determination. Meanwhile, claims in the next probability tier move through the traditional review process, with medical records requested for clinician review before determination.Proving a ConceptAs part of the test, Gainwell first compared findings from the Intelligent Review process to findings from standard record reviews. After validating the quality of the Intelligent Review algorithms, and determining that they were indeed accurate, we focused on measuring the amount of claims that could flow through this process. In a state recovery audit contractor (RAC) pilot, we found that 25% of claim reviews were able to be conducted without a record request, significantly lowering the administrative burden on providers. And because the Intelligent Review process can be easily deployed in a pre-pay environment, it actually lowers the administrative burden all the way down the line by making sure claims are paid correctly the first time. This data-driven, automated approach has now moved from concept to proven solution. Medical records are requested only when required for determination, and providers can still review preliminary findings and submit records for claims they believe were billed accurately, without impacting their appeal rights. For payers, overpayment recovery is accelerated as claims with a high probability of error move into a separate workflow. The review and technical denial process for these claims is reduced from 90 days to 15-20 days. All outcomes, including appeals, continually feed into Gainwell’s AI models, driving future claim selection. Embracing the FutureAs Intelligent Review has proven, AI can be elevated as an integral part of payment integrity, increasing innovation and helping states make the best use of healthcare dollars. With AI, clinical claim reviews become an even more valuable part of a digital health ecosystem, using smart technology to contain costs and drive innovation in the payment process.The future of clinical claim reviews is here — and AI is enhancing the process.

Integrated Care Management Delivers Value to Recipients, States |  & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Integrated Care Management Delivers Value to Recipients, States October 11, 2022Historically, healthcare has focused on a person’s … health.As we’ve learned more about the significant role that social determinants of health play in a person’s well-being, however, providers are realizing that they must focus on whole person care. This includes not only patients’ medical, dental and behavioral needs, but also their social needs. In fact, we are seeing care management, which has traditionally focused on medical needs, shifting to not only looking at social needs, but sometimes looking at them first.Aggregating and Assessing DataJust as a health risk assessment (HRA) can score a patient’s health, a health-related social needs (HRSN) assessment can identify unmet needs around housing, food and transportation that could affect a patient’s well-being. An HRA can frame up what a patient needs to do to improve medical outcomes, with the care manager suggesting steps to help the patient achieve their goals. The HRSN assessment pinpoints issues that must be stabilized before the patient can fully focus on these medical needs. If transportation is an issue, for instance, the patient could be connected to taxi vouchers or bus passes. If there is food insecurity in the home, the patient could be referred to a community food bank.Both medical and social information can be collected in almost any situation: primary care visits, case manager interviews, mailings — whatever best engages the patient. In fact, the opportunity to collect valuable information exists any time a patient interacts in any type of healthcare setting. Data from a variety of sources can provide a rich, holistic picture of a patient’s health and well-being — that is, when the data is made available to the care team. Oftentimes, however, this data is locked up in silos across multiple organizations.This is where care management platforms come in.Automating and Standardizing ProcessesAn effective care management platform can pull data from multiple, diverse sources and seamlessly aggregate it into one convenient location, enabling informed decision-making. The platform is much more than just a data repository, however. When built on a solid foundation of automation, standardization and mature processes, it makes the data not only available, but also useful and actionable.The right platform allows providers, specialists, care managers and even the patient to exchange data. This simplifies care coordination and allows the entire multidisciplinary care team to have the same view of the patient, as well as a unified plan for the patient’s journey. As each team member interacts with the patient, the information is updated, and the view of the patient comes into even sharper focus.Having everything in one place simplifies tasks and creates efficiency. It also allows care managers to be more proactive. For instance, imagine a provider has submitted a prior authorization (PA) request for a particular service. A care manager can see the PA in the system and know that there is a newly diagnosed disease, even before a claim is filed. With that information, the care manager can put interventions in place, without a delay in care.Empowering Care Managers An integrated platform fully supports the entire process of care assessment, planning, coordination and management. All of the data, plans and processes are in one convenient place, supplementing a care manager’s knowledge with proven pathways that lead to improved patient outcomes.Gainwell’s care management system, for example, provides standardized HRAs from nationally recognized colleges and academies that assess medical conditions such as diabetes, COPD and congestive heart failure. Another big component of our platform looks at health-related social needs. A utilization management module promotes the best use of resources, while ensuring high-quality care.The system looks at a patient’s medical, behavioral, dental and social risks and history, and uses predictive analytics to automate care plans. Once the plan is established, standardized rules create a workflow to lead the team members through a series of tasks, empowering them to make data-driven decisions. The flexibility of the platform allows clients to configure the system to their own best practices and specific model of care — without requiring a technical effort on the part of users.Providing the Right Information at the Right TimeTo make it easier for patients to receive help, it’s necessary to make it easier for care givers to give help. An interoperable care management system does just that, equipping care managers with the right information at the right time.For those of us who live and breathe healthcare, we forget that not everyone understands the healthcare system like we do. People don’t always know where to get help — and sometimes, they might not even know that they need help. Truly integrated care management allows those of us who can more easily navigate the healthcare system help those who can’t.

Fueling the FHIR on Interoperability |  & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Early FHIR Adoption:6 Lessons Learned September 1, 2023On May 1, 2020, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published the Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule, designed to enable a connected healthcare system where a streamlined flow of information breaks down siloes, enhances decision-making and ultimately improves health outcomes. To enable this seamless flow of data, CMS specified Health Level 7 (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Release 4.0.1. as the data exchange standard.Three years (and one pandemic) later, where does this initiative stand?CMS has exercised enforcement discretion around certain provisions and deadlines, so not every state has made the same level of progress. Some, however, have taken the leap and are setting up to adopt the next set of regulations, including new payer-to-payer APIs and planning for prior authorizations.Through ’ experience guiding 15 states to full compliance with the original Final Rule — and currently supporting five more states in their journeys — we have compiled a set of lessons learned to ease the burden of future implementations while maximizing flexibility and project outcomes.Prioritize Consistent Data Even though states are working with essentially the same kind of data, it’s not consistently maintained — neither within nor across state systems. Even if formats started out the same among agencies, so many differences have been introduced over time that there’s now a great deal of variance within the data.Sound, data-driven decision-making relies on a foundation of accurate and complete information. Any compliance effort should start with ensuring that all systems have access to consistent, clean data.Ensure Quality Through Rigorous ReviewsThe importance of comprehensive and granular quality reviews cannot be overstated. In fact, we’ve transformed our own quality assurance processes based on what we’ve learned over the past several years.Conducting more reviews up front helps to uncover issues that might slow down the process later. Identifying each source of data, then mapping and documenting how it will be digested by the various systems, is crucial to ensuring a seamless flow of accurate data.Leverage Standards to Speed Compliance FHIR provides a standard endpoint for a state’s data sources and is absolutely critical for enabling interoperability between systems. FHIR provides a foundation for a truly interconnected healthcare system, but it also allows agencies to build out exciting new capabilities.We’ve encouraged our clients to think of the FHIR standard as an enabler of innovation — and as the race to interoperability continues, we recommend they look at Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) data the same way.Using T-MSIS as the standard format for data is one of the reasons our clients moved forward so quickly. Taking an existing format and leveraging it for input into FHIR is allowing states to accelerate their compliance efforts.Build, Then Grow Once states have properly implemented FHIR, they’ve effectively established a beachhead from which to expand. Many have already been able to make enhancements to the platform and are considering additional ways to innovate, such as importing and analyzing data on social determinants of health. And once states are compliant with the current government regulations, they will have the ability to more easily adapt their existing systems to support future regulations.Consider New PerspectivesStates are the undisputed experts on their Medicaid programs, but bringing in a different perspective can also speed modernization projects.Gainwell, for example, has worked with so many states over the years that we have built up a wealth of institutional knowledge — knowledge that allowed us to step up to the challenge of the Final Rule and will enable us to address future regulations for our clients.Embrace the Future, TodayBy starting early, we’ve had time to work through challenges with our clients, and we know what we’re looking for now. Accordingly, our clients are now much farther down the road to interoperability.CMS has not strictly enforced compliance, but that could always change. And the lift could also be heavier with the next round of regulations.The best time for states to accelerate their compliance efforts was three years ago. The next best time is today.

Elevating Experiences Across Health and Human Services Programs | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Elevating Experiences Across Health and Human Services Programs June 21, 2024With the adoption of the Quadruple Aim, the healthcare industry took a giant step toward improving the lives of patients, populations and providers. In this vision, healthcare is human-centered and engaging.Healthcare technology should be the same.Embracing the Future TodayAs health IT systems mature, states don’t have to stay locked into technology that is out of touch with today’s demands.By integrating modern technologies as they become available, states can create a user experience that transcends their old systems. New front ends can provide experiences that are as intuitive and easy to use as popular consumer platforms. While states make plans for the future, these enhanced user experiences allow mission-critical systems to keep serving their vital role, while also offering greater efficiency and accessibility.Designing for TomorrowUpdating Medicaid systems requires updated ways of thinking about system design. And this is where design thinking comes in. Design thinking is the philosophy of taking an empathetic, human-centered approach to software development. It upends old ways of development by directly involving the technology’s users in the process. By identifying exactly who will be using the technology and what challenges they face, design thinking allows systems to be more agile, open and user-focused.Simplifying ComplexityAs organizations look to improve the user experience for a broad variety of constituents, micro-frontends provide one way to simplify complexity. With micro-frontend architecture, a wide array of features can be created separately then assembled together seamlessly. This approach allows parts of a user interface to be updated, fixed or expanded without disrupting an agency’s system or workflow. It’s about making software more flexible and resilient, ensuring it grows and adapts to meet an organization’s needs without missing a beat.Empowering UsersPicture a configurable, dynamic workspace personalized to each user in a state agency. By accessing products and tools made available by the agency, each user is able to organize their workspace to fit exactly how they work. And each time they log in, everything they need is right there in front of them. This vision of streamlined organization is technology that is available now.Users can add, move or remove tiles based on their needs. They can customize views. They can populate dashboards with charts and graphs that help them understand their workloads and manage tasks. Rather than being agency-centered, workspaces now become person-centered. Users no longer need to click through multiple windows to find what they need. Looking up Medicaid claims, approvals, denials and other crucial information is as simple as typing into a search bar. The process now becomes “search first, click later.”Supporting the EcosystemThis concept of simplified user experiences can be expanded across the whole healthcare ecosystem. Beneficiaries no longer need to navigate a confusing array of websites, forms, physical locations and call centers. Instead, they can access the full spectrum of health and human services through a single platform. Device-agnostic front ends feature responsive designs that meet beneficiaries wherever they are, through their desktop, cellphone, tablet or other device. An enhanced user experience is also key to reducing the administrative burden on clinicians. Many processes — from recredentialing to excuse notices — are dramatically streamlined, saving providers valuable time to focus on their patients. Delivering ResultsCreating a system that anticipates users’ needs, simplifies their workflow and brings new levels of efficiency offers profound benefits.Speed and Efficiency: By reducing the number of clicks it takes to get to relevant information, and enabling search comparisons on the same screen, an enhanced user experience saves agencies time and makes every moment spent in their system more valuable. Improved Access to Information: Pulling data from disparate systems and consolidating it onto a single platform — then layering it with a simplified user experience — reduces inefficiencies, inconvenience and incomplete data analysis. Vast quantities of information are now made accessible to the right people in the right place at the right time. Better Outcomes: With patient data now available in real time, physicians are able to easily monitor and manage treatment plans, resulting in better clinical and financial outcomes. State employees can also use the data they possess to improve the health of entire populations. Cost Savings: A next-generation user experience helps lower costs by automating repetitive tasks and giving data analysts the information they need to gain cost-saving insights. States could save millions of dollars through greater transparency into the care of their beneficiaries, from avoidance of duplicate medical tests to early intervention that prevents the need for costly medications. Reimagining the PossibleThe next generation of user experiences is not just a step forward; it’s a leap into the future of healthcare administration. States now have the opportunity to go beyond just upgrading their systems to actually infusing efficiency into every interaction.Improving user experiences is all about connecting people to what they need faster and more directly. And that goes a long way toward creating better outcomes for everyone.

Medicaid membership grew over 25% during the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), totaling more than 93 million enrollees in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program as of March 2023.Redetermining eligibility for the members added during that time period is a massive nationwide effort. With more than 15 million Americans poised to lose their Medicaid coverage during the unwinding, it is critical to find a more efficient and effective way to notify them they may no longer be eligible.The CMS Interoperability and Patient Access final rule focuses on several related issues. It was designed to drive transparency and access to members’ health data. This calls for innovative solutions that streamline agency processes while reducing costs and empower members by enabling them to play a larger role in their own healthcare .Unlocking the Power of Mobile Platforms to Engage MembersDigital transformation in the healthcare industry has been accelerating rapidly, particularly since the pandemic increased our reliance on technology to communicate and access care-related information.Meeting people where they are makes digital access a powerful solution today. It’s even more valuable for the Medicaid member population, whose location or circumstance may make them more difficult to reach and whose health and social care needs may be disproportionately complex.Mobile technology is an essential tool to help members manage their own healthcare. Pew Research survey data shows 97% of Americans own a cell phone, and 85% have a smartphone. Among some of American’s most vulnerable communities, smartphone reliance has increased significantly over the last decade and is the primary means of internet access for many, particularly those who do not have a home broadband connection, according to the Pew survey.Mobile platforms play a key role in bridging the digital divide, offering numerous benefits to a population that historically has been overlooked in the realm of person-centered innovation. These benefits include:Convenience. People typically have their mobile phone with them at all times, anywhere and everywhere. They can review and respond to communications when it works best for them.Security. Health data can be transmitted and contained securely, with a focus on protecting an individual’s private medical information.Patient empowerment. Patients have immediate access to information wherever and whenever they want or need it.Proactive engagement and intervention. Medicaid programs can send members important messages such as reminders about preventive care, upcoming appointments and other health-related information.Mobile access is playing an increasingly pivotal role for acquiring and managing one’s personal health data. Driving Efficiency, Sustainability and Cost SavingsEnabling digital access to Medicaid data also provides benefits for states, such as operational efficiencies through streamlined administrative processes and digitally sharing data between members and the state. This capability complies with CMS’ final rule by allowing data to flow freely and securely between payers, providers and patients.Another benefit is significant cost savings. Having members’ ID cards on their smartphone or other mobile device eliminates the need for state agencies to process, print and mail plastic cards and replacement cards — typically between $2 and $4 per card. That savings is adding up for the state of Nevada, currently reducing their costs from between $60,000 and $100,000 annually by not printing plastic cards.Other Medicaid documents and information also can be sent digitally, again saving substantial printing and mailing costs. Digital solutions provide a greener, more sustainable alternative.Transforming the Medicaid Member Experience, Lightening the BurdenDigital access truly can help states realize CMS’ vision of patient-centered care: That patients can access their data at no additional cost via the tools they choose.At a time when millions of Americans are predicted to lose coverage, re-enroll or change health plans, it’s more important than ever that patients, providers and payers have the same access to secure, free-flowing information. Embracing digital solutions will enable that access and put agencies on a path toward patient-centered care, better health outcomes and streamlined processes as they manage these vital programs.

Innovation in Healthcare Utilization Management | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Innovation Transforms Utilization Management and Healthcare Future April 6, 2023The healthcare industry is facing a number of challenges, from rising costs and insurance premiums to workforce shortages, cybersecurity threats and complex payment processing and invoicing systems.With administrative costs accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the $4.3 trillion spent on healthcare in a year, utilization management programs are critical to reducing these costs relative to overall program management spending. Utilization management is widely recognized as a valuable process for evaluating the medical necessity, efficiency and appropriateness of healthcare services, procedures and facilities.From a care quality perspective, utilization management helps Medicaid programs and health plans achieve the “4 Rs:” delivering care at the right time, in the right place, to the right patient, at the right cost. Here’s how innovation is transforming the process.Advanced Tools of the TradeArtificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools use advanced data analysis to continuously learn over time — with little human intervention required outside of providing the data. It’s exciting to consider AI/ML’s ever-accelerating value in healthcare, particularly when it comes to addressing administrative burden in today’s overstretched workforce.AI/ML is reducing administrative costs by enabling greater clinical efficiency, significantly reduced manual labor, increased diagnosis speed and accuracy, and better use of data and resources. When it comes to utilization management, these tools can greatly improve and streamline utilization management processes, such as case identification and decision making. By connecting disparate data, AI/ML creates a more complete patient profile, finding things we may have missed otherwise and better informing the decision-making process.Streamlining the Healthcare Administration ContinuumWhen applied to utilization management, AI/ML can help states and healthcare organizations achieve numerous benefits, including:Improved patient outcomes due to more accurate information and decision-making support, leading to better patient careReduced medical costs by ensuring patients are getting the right care from the right physician at the right place at the right time, eliminating overspendingImproved access to data analytics, which can be used along with machine learning to create models used within artificial intelligenceReduced administrative burden and costs through more efficient processes and more readily accessible and comprehensive conclusionsIdentifying Patterns, Raising FlagsAI/ML can see outside typical patterns. Plus, it has the capability to continually learn from corrections to case decisions, expand on any rules put in place and pull from medical necessity guidelines to reach increasingly smart, complex conclusions. The results will help improve patient outcomes.For example, a cardiologist is recommending knee surgery for a patient rather than a heart-related procedure. This might raise questions since it’s not that physician’s specialty. AI/ML can analyze historical requests and patterns to support that recommendation.Another example might be a service recommended for a patient. Based on the metadata and a review of medical necessity criteria, the service is not recommended for a patient under 18 years of age. This patient is child. AI/ML was able to identify important decision-making criteria in this case.Going Beyond Rules-based Engine AbilitiesEqually as important to understanding AI and ML’s abilities is also knowing what they cannot do. They cannot provide systemic decisioning based on rules engines.A rules engine may be the foundational knowledge of the “brain,” but it’s not AI. It will do exactly what you’ve told it to do and nothing more, nothing less. It’s important to be informed and understand that capabilities marketed as AI/ML may not, in fact, be AI/ML.AI/ML leaves it to the Medicaid enterprise system or other or other healthcare information systems to think about parameters based on the metadata such as patient or physician information and diagnosis and service information. This includes historical decisions, corrections to past systemic decisions, trend analysis, the latest medical necessity criteria and other metadata. The system is not merely running data through a rules engine and by doing it automatically, it is increasing efficiency and reducing administrative costs by reducing manual work.Used in software for medical devices, AI/ML is able to learn from real-world use and improve its performance, assisting healthcare providers and improving patient care. Virtual nursing assistants use AI/ML to reduce hospital and clinic visits by performing timely checks via voice — managing progress and lightening the burden on medical professionals.Healthcare AI/ML FutureHealthcare AI/ML will continue to gain traction as this technology incorporates into nonclinical administrative processes, medical devices, patient engagement and medical training. It presents limitless potential to maximize knowledge, resources and efficiency within the healthcare industry.

From Mandate to Modernization: How to Take a Strategic Approach to H.R. 1 | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: From Mandate to Modernization: How to Take a Strategic Approach to H.R. 1 September 30, 2025States are scrambling to begin adapting their Medicaid programs to meet the provisions of H.R. 1 (One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025). Changes are substantial, and the work ahead is daunting. Residency and work-verification mandates tighten eligibility. Fraud, waste, and abuse rules sharpen. Provider-tax provisions threaten already thin budgets.While adapting to mandates is nothing new for Medicaid leaders, this is uncharted territory. It’s no surprise that leaders have a lot of questions about how H.R. 1 will impact coverage, eligibility systems, funding, system updates, operations and processing, and more. What’s more, tight timelines mean that states can’t wait to act before they have all of the answers.Unfunded Mandate or Modernization Launchpad?On the surface, H.R. 1 looks like one more unfunded mandate. Look closer, and it has the potential to be something entirely different, and much better. With the right approach, states can use H.R. 1 as a launchpad for faster modernization.Just imagine the possibilities. A residency discrepancy is flagged the day it happens, not months later. A single, member-centric workflow verifies community-engagement status without driving churn. Dashboard KPIs tie every recovered dollar to a modernization milestone such as an analytics layer, portal upgrade, or process automation.Three Ways to Unlock H.R. 1 as a Modernization EngineMaking these things a reality requires more than the right mindset. It requires the right actions. We believe that states should set the foundation now by prioritizing these actions:Treat integrity savings as modernization capital. Every ineligible enrollee identified, and every duplicate capitation recovered becomes “found” funding. When agencies reinvest those dollars in modular technology and real-time analytics, the cycle is never negative. Dollars saved buy the next upgrade.Move from quarterly to continuous verification. Waiting on the PARIS file or annual sweeps is no longer viable. H.R. 1’s aggressive timelines demand monthly, and eventually daily, signals that catch multi-state enrollment, residency drift, and work requirement gaps before payments go out the door.Build agility into the eligibility perimeter. Rules will evolve; data sources will multiply. States need configurable engines that snap into legacy cores, ingest new data feeds on the fly, and surface clear “act-or-hold” recommendations that their staff can trust.State Medicaid agencies that pursue these actions will be in an enviable position. They will be able to free up resources even as H.R. 1 raises the bar. On the other hand, those that wait to act risk funding gaps, compliance findings, and member confusion.Thinking about community engagement verification?Explore an approach that that is independent of your eligibility system but fully integrated with it so you can meet critical federal requirements while flexing fast with change. Learn more.How to Get StartedA back-to-basics approach is a good way to get started on these actions. This means ensuring that operational fundamentals are in order and fully aligned. Start with the following:Inventory data readiness. Determine whether or not the agency can absorb third-party address, employment, and mortality data without a re-platform.Define “never-negative” ROI. Set a rule and stick to it: every integrity dollar must feed the modernization backlog, no exceptions.Choose partners who operate at national scale. Go with partners that know the full picture but also slot into your roadmap, bringing proven verification experience, modular technology, and accountability to outcomes.There is no ignoring the reality. H.R. 1 is here. The pressure is real. The concern is justified. As much concern that is swirling around this bill, there is a silver lining. With the right strategy and clear actions, states can use H.R. 1 to fuel the progress that their Medicaid program has needed all along.

Phased Modernization in Medicaid: A Smart Strategy for Provider System Upgrades | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Phased Modernization in Medicaid: A Smart Strategy for Provider System Upgrades September 5, 2025Author: Mason MabrySince its inception, Medicaid has faced challenges in engaging and retaining providers. Many of those challenges stem from the program’s inherent complexity and lower reimbursement rates — systemic issues that every provider must navigate. Implementing even simple policy changes can be cumbersome because of the time-consuming and expensive hard-coding required for some legacy provider systems. More concerning, these aging systems can often lead to data inconsistencies that degrade overall data quality. This combination of factors may lead to dissatisfied providers who then leave the Medicaid network, creating gaps in coverage for enrolled members.Why Provider Systems Need ModernizationModernizing provider systems and operational processes can solve many of these challenges and address several strategic goals. First, a modern system is essential for improving provider experiences, aligning them more closely with the frictionless interactions users expect. For providers, better experiences yield higher satisfaction. That, in turn, improves network adequacy and member access to care.Second, modernization helps optimize the way limited resources are used to keep a provider network healthy and engaged. With a more modernized system, agencies can reduce their spend on basic system maintenance, enrollment operations, and implementation of federal CMS or state policy changes.Finally, modern provider service platforms have better speed, agility, and scalability. By modernizing, agencies can adopt configurable systems and use business rules to exponentially improve adaptability. Similarly, by moving from on-premise to cloud-based provider systems, agencies gain the flexibility to throttle resources up or down depending on evolving needs.When Phased Modernization Makes SenseIn an ideal world, agencies could modernize their provider systems all at once. While this would be efficient, it can be impractical depending on budget constraints, workforces stretched thin because of conflicting priorities, and concern about straining provider communities.Phased modernization provides another approach for agencies that have invested significantly in legacy provider systems that remain fundamentally sound. These agencies can quickly and sustainably extend the life of their existing systems to enjoy several more years of productive use. By modernizing in phases, agencies can improve the provider experience, while also controlling costs and risks by limiting the scope of changes and their impact on the provider community.Similarly, phased modernization can be an appropriate choice for states that have elected to delay full system replacement for any number of reasons. These may typically include competing agency priorities, budget constraints, and the need to prioritize other critical business areas, such as member services or claims processing.Ultimately, phased modernization works best when a provider system can serve as a foundation for meaningful improvement, while the state extends its return on investment and plans for full modernization over the longer term.Phased Modernization of Provider Systems: Five Keys to SuccessIf your state has identified phased provider system modernization as a strong option, make sure you include these five critical capabilities to achieve your objectives:1. Strategic planning built through assessments and insightful analyticsUnderstanding your current position requires comprehensive benchmarking against key provider metrics. That includes comparing your performance against both neighboring states and national performance. Doing so demands a thorough operational assessment and comparative analytical capabilities that most states lack internally such as the ability to collect, normalize, and interpret complex performance data across multiple dimensions of provider experience.2. Objective-driven modernization roadmapOnce you understand your baseline performance, you need expertise in provider system best practices to set objectives that are realistic and achievable within specific timeframes. That process requires deep knowledge of what’s possible with different technologies and approaches — insight that comes from extensive experience across multiple implementations and diverse state environments.3. Real-time performance monitoringContinuous tracking of progress requires monitoring tools, dashboards, and expertise in relevant key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks. The ability to quickly identify when initiatives aren’t delivering expected results and to pivot accordingly are contingent on having a strong analytical foundation and continuous support to derive meaningful insights from the data.4. Provider engagement and change managementProvider communities are inherently diverse, presenting with varying needs, technical capabilities, and attitudes toward change. Successful phased modernization requires providers to be engaged early and often, from planning through execution and beyond. In fact, regular communication and feedback loops aren’t just helpful; they’re essential for ensuring that improvements translate into better provider experiences.5. Adaptable and reusable solutionsThe greatest advantage of modern approaches to phased modernization lies in shared development costs and continuous innovation. By treating the solution as a product, agencies can leverage centralized research and development that benefits all users. These solutions are reusable in more ways than one. First, because they are developed once and deployed broadly through rule-based configurability, they offer a scale advantage and shift states from working on IT developmental projects to deploying products. But perhaps more critically, these solutions aren’t temporary patches; they’re modern components that bridge the gap between old systems and new ones.Additionally, keep your eyes focused on the long-term goal of a product-based provider system. Avoid solutions that offer short-term progress that isn’t conducive to future full modernization and which burden providers with additional change and disruption. Instead, opt for phased modernization in which each of the discrete components contributes to an endgame of a modern provider solution.A Bridge to Full ModernizationThink of phased modernization as your strategic bridge for achieving near-term improvements while building toward inevitable full modernization. The goal is to build on existing investments while systematically addressing provider experience challenges based on priority and need, ultimately gaining operational efficiencies along the way.For virtually any state, success requires recognizing that this isn’t a simple internal project. From comprehensive analytics to specialized change management expertise, the resources required to execute in accordance with the five keys to success typically exceeds individual agencies’ capacity. The complexity of modern provider expectations, combined with the technical sophistication required to meet them, suggests the need to engage partners who offer proven experience and scale.Learn more about how Gainwell’s provider service capabilities, including Provider Flex and our Provider modernization consulting, can help you modernize intelligently.

It’s also a strategic investment in network adequacy and member access to care.When these systems make it easy to join and participate in a Medicaid network, providers benefit from streamlined processes — and Medicaid members gain improved access through enhanced provider recruitment and retention.Yet even with careful planning and significant investment, many provider system implementations fall short of their goals — leading to frustration for agencies, providers, and, ultimately, the people they serve.With more states exploring replacement or modernization of legacy provider systems, how can they increase their odds of success? Having worked with numerous state agencies on provider systems, Gainwell has identified six common pitfalls — along with strategies for avoiding them.Pitfall #1: Underestimating time and resource requirementsOne of the most frequent missteps is underestimating the resources required to meet what is often an aggressive timeline. Without proper resource commitment — including making knowledgeable and empowered employees available for regular engagement — project schedules become impossible to maintain.We’ve also observed similar challenges when it comes to data conversion. While agencies may expect the vendor to handle this work independently, the reality is more complex. If the provided data is poor in quality, the vendor will need to complete multiple iterations to achieve clean data conversion. But when data conversion falls behind schedule, it leads to delays in system integration testing, which then causes the state to miss user acceptance testing timelines, too.The bottom line? Allocating insufficient resources will put any initiative behind the proverbial eight ball, cascading into project-wide delays that can be difficult to overcome.Pitfall #2: Underinvesting in change managementMinimizing investment in internal and external change management is one of the most common implementation missteps. By assuming that it’ll be easy to communicate with state workers and network providers, agencies may not make the proper investment in organizational change support.The consequences can be dire — including systems being rejected when users can’t (or won’t) adapt to new processes. Without the right messaging and leadership support, implementations fail, defeating modernization goals and resulting in significant amounts of wasted money and effort.Notably, change management isn’t just about training; it’s about preparing people psychologically and operationally for new ways of working. Overlook this critical component, and even the most technically sound system can fail to gain adoption.Pitfall #3: Being unintentional about decision-making authorityMaking decisions by committee creates momentum-killing delays, while having the wrong decision-makers in critical meetings wastes valuable time. From the start of the project, it’s critical to appoint and empower clear decision-makers. In other words, identify and articulate who has the authority to make decisions across security and functional areas — and ensure those people are available to support critical meetings.Requirement validation sessions provide a prime example of this principle in action. If key decision-makers are absent, the sessions are rendered futile. The best-case scenario? The meetings must be rescheduled. The worst case? Completed work must be redone with the proper stakeholders present.Pitfall #4: Choosing a vendor that doesn’t know the terms and conditionsContracts for provider system implementations are typically complex, prompting detailed questions from Medicaid agency workers throughout the process. If a vendor’s staff lack contract knowledge and requirements mastery, they may struggle to answer such questions quickly and accurately.Vendor teams need to be well prepared with contract information and requirement details — with a clear understanding of how requirements are met before client meetings begin. If a vendor can’t answer basic questions, such as How many SLAs are in our contract? or What specifically does our agreement say about data security requirements?, it erodes trust and creates early credibility gaps that can be difficult to close.Pitfall #5: Getting stuck in a cycle of reactive issue resolutionThere will always be urgent issues — no matter how well prepared the vendor and agency teams may be. But firefighting shouldn’t become the focus. When teams spend all their time responding to immediate crises, they lose sight of the bigger picture and fall behind on proactive planning activities. To stay on track, teams need to have sufficient capacity for proactive work, including risk identification, process improvement, and strategic planning.Pitfall #6: Falling prey to siloed communicationProvider system implementations require cross-functional involvement from multiple teams, departments, and often external stakeholders. But if these teams stay within their silos, they will cause ongoing confusion and create unnecessary rework.When realignment becomes a constant reality, people aren’t sure which direction to go. In many case, they’ll just stand still, waiting for clarity that may never come. This paralysis can bring progress to a halt — and create frustration across all stakeholders.Six strategies for successIf those are among the most common pitfalls, what are the strategies for avoiding them? The best way to start is by choosing the right vendors — organizations that bring extensive experience implementing modern provider solutions and offer demonstrated strengths in leading and coordinating across six critical areas.1. Comprehensive change managementLook for vendors with proven experience engaging internal and external stakeholders, whether directly or in support of internal staff. Successful change management requires commitment and clear messaging upfront to bring change forward, along with leadership alignment and consistent messaging. The most effective vendors also know that change management is an ongoing process that requires attention, resources, and expertise throughout the project lifecycle.2. Thorough staff preparationSuccessful initiatives require vendor teams to get aligned on objectives, requirements, and SLAs from day one. This includes creating a common language framework for all stakeholders and securing contract knowledge mastery before client meetings begin.Vendor staff must know contract details, requirements, and how requirements are met. They should be able to provide direct explanations of what the product does and how it meets specific requirements rather than learning such details on the job.3. Proactive issue resolution processesThe best vendors establish teams and protocols recognize they’ll face unexpected challenges no matter how well prepared they are. The key is to have mechanisms to respond more efficiently when issues arise. By building capacity for both reactive problem-solving and proactive risk management, the team can handle urgent issues without losing momentum on planned activities.4. Decision-making clarityEffective vendors work with agencies to identify and empower the right decision-makers upfront. Teams can then move forward knowing that the choices they’re making have proper backing and won’t need to be revisited later.5. Regular communication cadencesFrom the very beginning of a project, successful vendors establish communication standards among clients, vendors, and teams. That includes establishing and maintaining alignment among interdependent teams by holding weekly workstream lead calls where every team provides status updates. Effective communication also means aligning communications to SLAs and requirements. Strive to create a common language that all stakeholders can understand and use consistently.6. Collaborative spiritChoose vendors willing to partner with the agency and with each other. After all, there’s no room for egos or competition in a successful implementation. Seek vendors with extensive experience with similar projects, as they will be better positioned to anticipate and address emerging challenges.The stakes are highFailed provider system implementations squander money and time and erode provider trust. When providers become frustrated with system problems, they may choose to limit their Medicaid participation or leave the network entirely — potentially reducing members’ access to care. By avoiding classic pitfalls and focusing on success strategies, state agencies can increase their odds of achieving implementations that truly serve their providers, members, and broader healthcare goals. Just as important, look for a partner with the experience to anticipate challenges and have solutions ready — along with a collaborative spirit to bring together multiple stakeholders and systems.

Using Self-Service Innovation to Streamline Provider Experiences | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Using Self-Service Innovation to Streamline Provider Experiences May 21, 2025(3 of 4)(In this third installment of our four-part series on Provider Experiences, we examine empowering providers throughout the process.) Navigating the Medicaid enrollment process can often feel like deciphering a puzzle. Inconsistent enrollment application elements across the broad network of payers leads to confusion and prolonged processing times. Following submission, providers often struggle to track the status of their applications and understand the next steps in the enrollment journey. Here are some innovative ways to bring clarity to the process.Promote More TransparencyProviders need the ability to track their application status after submission. One of the primary reasons providers contact call centers is to inquire about the status of their enrollment application.Extend Self-Service CapabilitiesIn today’s world, people are accustomed to self-service options, from grocery store checkouts to airport kiosks. Medicaid agencies can enhance their portals and user interfaces to offer a similar experience. Providers should easily update and manage their information, submit claims, check member eligibility, access the provider directory, request prior authorization, and more.One approach to engaging with providers effectively is the use of an AI-powered conversational voicebots and chatbots to revolutionize self-service. At one Medicaid agency, in just nine months, this innovation reduced call volume to agents by 34%. Additionally, because of its effectiveness, callers enjoy quicker access to the information they need, spending 30% less time interacting with the voicebot compared to the traditional Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. This frees up provider and agent availability and allows agents to focus on more complex calls and escalations.Leverage Existing Data When AvailableGainwell’s insights reveal that the average enrollment form has over 185 fields, with more than 70% of this information available elsewhere. By utilizing existing data from credible data registries and other sources, Medicaid agencies can eliminate the need for applicants to re-enter known information and can automate data exchanges with those sources to further reduce provider data update requirements.Use AI to Predict and Eliminate Risk and ErrorsAI is a powerful tool for psychographic profiling, quickly classifying providers based on their interactions with enrollment systems to predict their experiences. Providers’ psychographic risk scores are available to call centers to prevent adverse experiences. Medicaid agencies can use this approach to predict providers at risk of negative experiences based on portal touchpoints, surveys, call center interactions, emails, complex patients, and prior authorization denials. Once identified, they can target those providers for reconciliation efforts to repair their experiences and prevent them from exiting Medicaid or limiting new patient acceptance.AI can also predict providers likely to face issues such as failed enrollments, revalidations, or return to providers (RTPs) due to missing data. With this insight, agencies can proactively develop training, call center and support protocols to close the underlying gaps that cause these issues. Apply Process Mining and Journey MappingBy creating process models and provider journey maps of high-risk areas, Medicaid agencies can take a comprehensive, “outside-in” look at all elements of the provider experience to identify and address improvement opportunities. This kind of approach points to functionality and process changes that will resolve pain points and improve provider experience outcomes. Strong data analytics enable agencies and vendors monitor improvement over time and ensure that these intervention tactics are working.Look for our final installment in this series coming soon.

Enhancing Provider Experiences: Simplifying the Process | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Enhancing Provider Experiences: Simplifying the Process May 14, 2025(2 of 4)(In this second installment of our four-part series on Provider Experiences, we focus on simplifying the revalidation process.) Revalidation is a necessary but often burdensome process for providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and states mandate that providers revalidate their enrollment every three to five years. This requirement can be particularly taxing for large groups, facilities, and hospitals with numerous providers. The process can lead to the termination of non-responsive providers and challenges in meeting the required timeframe for revalidation.Enrollment administrators, especially those overseeing large practices or hospital systems, face significant challenges due to the complexity and time required for updates. On average, completing a revalidation takes about 30 minutes per provider, with some specialties taking even longer. When multiplied by hundreds of providers, this becomes a substantial efficiency issue, often necessitating full-time resources dedicated to re-enrollments.Strategies for Simplifying RevalidationTo address these challenges, state Medicaid agencies can implement several strategies to simplify the revalidation process:Bulk Enrollment and RevalidationBulk enrollment and revalidation streamline provider re-enrollment by automating the processing of multiple updates at once, saving time and effort compared to handling individual updates. This is especially beneficial for managing large groups, such as providers within a practice or hospital system. By pulling in data from existing enrollment records, the process becomes more of a review than a new submission, allowing providers to quickly verify and update their information. This results in faster, more efficient re-enrollments with fewer errorsLeveraging Medicare Provider InformationThe Medicare Provider, Enrollment, Chain, and Ownership System (PECOS) contains validated information about providers’ standing and CMS status. By accessing this system, state Medicaid agencies can reduce the administrative burden of duplicate data entry. For instance, Arkansas uses PECOS data to determine if Medicaid revalidation can be completed based on data matching, streamlining the process for both providers and the state.Eliminating Unnecessary RequirementsState Medicaid agencies can review current revalidation activities to identify opportunities for streamlining. This may involve removing redundant provider agreement and attachment requirements and simplifying the application format. By working within CMS guidelines, agencies can make the revalidation process more efficient and less burdensome for providers.Innovation in PracticeOne state is enhancing provider experience by streamlining initial enrollment and revalidation within its Medicaid Enterprise System. Key to this transformation is the implementation of bulk initial enrollment and revalidation. In the near future, groups, hospitals, and facilities will be able to submit their entire provider network for system checks and reconciliation against National Provider Identifier and taxonomy combinations without needing separate applications.Automation of the screening and review process will significantly reduce manual application reviews. Revalidation applications will be prepopulated with existing data, eliminating redundant data entry. Additionally, the state’s connection to PECOS allows some providers to bypass the revalidation requirement altogether. If PECOS has the NPI and a current validation, the revalidation date is updated to align with PECOS, negating the need for a second revalidation.Since implementing these changes, half of the state’s providers no longer need revalidation. Future plans include incorporating more PECOS data, such as site visit information, fingerprinting, and background checks, to further reduce administrative burdens.Moreover, the state’s medical assistance portal offers providers fast-track options, including the ability to complete disclosure statements at any time. These disclosures are systematically screened, reducing approval time to 15 minutes and eliminating the need for manual staff review.ConclusionSimplifying the revalidation process is a crucial step in reducing friction for providers. By implementing bulk enrollment, leveraging existing Medicare provider information, and eliminating unnecessary requirements, state Medicaid agencies can make revalidation more efficient and less burdensome. These innovations not only improve the provider experience but also enhance the overall efficiency of the Medicaid system.Stay tuned for the next part in our series, where we will explore how to empower providers throughout the process.

Elevating Provider Experiences: Mastering Enrollment from the Start | Gainwell & Public Health Commercial & Payer Solutions Medicaid Enterprise Data & Analytics Provider Solutions Human Services & Public Health Solutions Systems Integration & Interoperability Pharmacy Solutions Coordination of Benefits Payment Integrity Care Quality Population Health Insights Case Studies News Blog Posts Videos White Papers Who We Are Our Culture Gainwell Cares Awards Events Careers US Careers India Careers Contact Us Search for: Elevating Provider Experiences: Mastering Enrollment from the Start May 7, 2025(1 of 4)(In this first installment of our four-part series on Provider Experiences, we explore the crucial strategy of getting enrollment right from the start.)Provider enrollment is often time-consuming and complex. Our analysis shows providers typically have several clicks or pages to navigate before reaching the enrollment application. Completing the application can take as much as two hours, 18 steps, and 150 fields. Steps within steps add more complexity and frustration. After all this effort, applications are often returned because information is incorrect or missing, requiring resubmission.States with intelligent provider solutions can analyze data to pinpoint friction during enrollment. For instance, it helps to know the average number of submissions to complete an application, which questions are answered incorrectly or left blank, and how often applicants contact the call center — and why. It’s also insightful to know return to provider (RTP) metrics by provider and specialty. Fast, first-pass provider enrollment can help end this cycle of inefficiency.Streamlining the Enrollment Process: How Screen Guidance and Checklists Enhance Provider ExperienceScreen guidance and a pre-enrollment checklist can greatly improve a provider’s experience when completing an enrollment application. Screen guidance offers step-by-step instructions, reducing confusion and errors, while the checklist helps providers prepare all necessary documents in advance, speeding up the process and minimizing delays. Together, these tools make the enrollment experience more efficient and user-friendly.Optimizing Provider Experience: Seamless Enrollment with GUI, Auto-Fill, and Unified ViewsBy shifting the mindset from traditional UI (User Interface) to a more intuitive GUI (Graphical User Interface), providers can have a significantly smoother experience when completing an enrollment application. This evolution includes features like dynamically rendering applications and auto-filled, pre-validated data, reducing the need for repetitive data entry and minimizing errors. With automated, “one-click” processes, providers can quickly complete tasks with a single action, further streamlining the experience. Additionally, a unified and integrated experience allows providers to view all relevant information in one place, eliminating the need to navigate multiple screens or systems. These enhancements create a more efficient, seamless, and user-friendly enrollment process, saving providers time and reducing frustration.Streamlining Provider Enrollment: The Role of Bulk Uploads, Auto-Enrollment, and Data AutomationBulk uploads can speed up application data entry. Through the use of templates and bulk uploads, organizations can limit data entry and submission of multiple applications by performing many tasks at once. For example, organizations that continuously enroll similar providers into their group may only need to enter the shared office information into a provider enrollment template once, then apply it to all to reduce manual data entry.Some states are implementing auto-enrollment for simple application types and using automation to process certain specialties. For example, in Colorado, primary care providers are auto approved during the enrollment process. States and solution providers are also expanding opportunities to prepopulate enrollment application fields with third-party data from highly qualified national registry sources that simply need to be validated by the applicant.Vermont’s Success: Reducing Medicaid Provider Enrollment Time by Over 90%How extensive can these benefits be? Consider the case of Vermont, which implemented Gainwell’s Medicaid Enterprise System (MES) Provider Solutions in response to a high-priority legislative initiative to reduce the enrollment timeframe for Medicaid providers. The project’s original goal was to reduce the average provider enrollment timeframe from 120 days to less than 30 days. The approach exceeded the original goal by processing 100% of all applications under 30 days since implementation while utilizing 36% fewer staff.Vermont was able to:Decrease average provider application time from one to two hours to 15 minutesDecrease average application screening time from more than one hour to 20 minutesInitial 150% increase of monthly enrollment and revalidation processing, which continues to be maintainedConclusionEnhancing the provider experience is essential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Medicaid services. By focusing on key elements of the enrollment application and simplifying the overall process, we can significantly improve the provider journey, resulting in better outcomes for both providers and members.Look for our next installment of our series as we focus on simplifying the revalidation process.
